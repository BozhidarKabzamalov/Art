The application utilizes the Model-View-Controller architecture which separates the application into three parts - model, view and controller. The MVC architecture is employed because it provides a large number of benefits like:

* Separation of concerns
* Easy maintenance thanks to the separation of concerns
* Supports test-driven development
* Fast development process
* Possibility for parallel work on different modules
